ðŸŒ€ 3D Platformer
Gravity Platformer Game

This prototype was created for an assignment requiring the implementation of a third-person character with animations and three moving parts (e.g., platforms, bullets, etc.).

For my project, I developed a 3D Unity platformer featuring gravity-manipulation mechanics, allowing players to walk on ceilings and navigate challenging obstacle courses.
